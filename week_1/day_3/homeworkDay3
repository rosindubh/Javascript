Functions - JavaScript | MDN
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is 
similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a 
procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is 
some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it 
somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
