//Let’s create an alarm.


//Create a key called weekendAlarm, with a value saying “no alarm needed” and a key called weekdayAlarm, 
//with a value saying “get up at 7am”.

//Create a variable called day and one called alarm.

//If day is Saturday or Sunday, set alarm to weekendAlarm. If day is a weekday, set alarm to weekdayAlarm.

let day = 'saturday';
let alarm;
let weekend = 'no alarm';
let weekday = 'alarm';


const myAlarm = (day) {


if (day == 'saturday') 
  console.log(myAlarm(weekend);
}
myAlarm('saturday');
